- Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

With server-side routing, every request from the user refreshes the page. THis is because all of the data is being refreshed on every change. In addition, it can take a while for the page to be rendered. However, server-side routing can be nice because only the data the user needs will be pulled from the server. Also, SEO is quite kind to this form of routing.

In contrast, client-side routing allows for individual parts of the page to refresh solely based on what information changed. Because less data is being changed, the pages generally load faster and animations will be faster. However, SEO is difficult with it; there is also a lot more code involved, and data can be downloaded initially by the user that isn't being displayed in the app.
